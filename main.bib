	abstract = {From human language to birdsong and the chirps of insects, acoustic communication is based on amplitude and frequency modulation of sound signals. Whereas frequency processing starts at the level of the hearing organs, temporal features of the sound amplitude such as rhythms or pulse rates require processing by central auditory neurons. Besides several theoretical concepts, brain circuits that detect temporal features of a sound signal are poorly understood. We focused on acoustically communicating field crickets and show how five neurons in the brain of females form an auditory feature detector circuit for the pulse pattern of the male calling song. The processing is based on a coincidence detector mechanism that selectively responds when a direct neural response and an intrinsically delayed response to the sound pulses coincide. This circuit provides the basis for auditory mate recognition in field crickets and reveals a principal mechanism of sensory processing underlying the perception of temporal patterns.},

abstract ={A formal semantics for low-level perceptual aspects of meaning is presented, tying these together with the logical-inferential aspects of meaning traditionally studied in formal semantics. The key idea is to model perceptual meanings as classifiers of perceptual input. Furthermore, we show how perceptual aspects of meaning can be updated as a result of observing language use in interaction, thereby enabling fine-grained semantic plasticity and semantic coordination. This requires a framework where intensions are (i) represented independently of extensions, and (ii) structured objects which can be modified as a result of learning. We use Type Theory with Records (TTR), a formal semantics framework that starts from the idea that information and meaning is founded on our ability to perceive and classify the world, i.e. to perceive objects and situations as being of types. As an example of our approach, we show how a simple classifier of spatial information based on the Perceptron can be cast in TTR.},

In this paper we present representations and mechanisms that are necessary for continuous learning of visual concepts in dialogue with a tutor. We present an approach for modelling beliefs stemming from multiple modalities and we show how these beliefs are created by processing visual and linguistic information and how they are used for learning. We also present a system that exploits these representations and mechanisms, and demonstrate these principles in the case of learning about object colours and basic shapes in dialogue with the tutor.},

  abstract = {This thesis is about an
	 implementation of a voice controlled dialogue system called Dico
	 (the Latin word for "I talk"), that is made for controlling a cell
	 phone. It is based on a dialogue where the user does not have to learn
	 a lot of commands to run the cell phone, but can speak in a more
	 natural way. It is also possible for the user to give the requested
	 information in an optional course; the user does not have to wait
	 for the system to ask for information but can give all information
	 at once. The dialogue system handles question accommodation, which
	 enables for the user to begin one task, and then switch to another task
	 before the first one is done. When the second task is completed the
	 system automatically returns to the first task and continues with
	 that which gives the user freedom to switch between tasks whenever
	 s/he wants. Two test sessions were made, with six participants in
	 each session, to evaluate the system. The second session, where the
	 recognition rate was much better than the first one, showed that the
	 participants felt calm using the system, they did not experience that their
	 concentration level was high and it was easy to learn how to use
	 the system even though they did not get any demo introduction at
	 all. This thesis shows that a voice controlled dialogue system is
	 an interesting field for the automotive industry, since the user
	 test showed that it was easy to learn and not distracting to use.},
